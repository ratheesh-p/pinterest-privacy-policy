  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 6, 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how our Pinterest Automation Application
    ("App", "we", "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use
    our service to automate pin creation on Pinterest.
  </p>
  <p>
    This App is operated from Bangalore, Karnataka, India and primarily serves
    users in India. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying
    with applicable data protection laws, including the Information Technology
    Act, 2000, relevant Indian data protection rules, and, where applicable,
    the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use our App, we may collect the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pinterest Account Information:</strong> Your Pinterest user ID, board information, and pins you create through our App.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Data:</strong> Images, titles, descriptions, and links you provide for automated pin creation.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with our App, including API requests and automation settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP address, browser type, and device information for security and functionality purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain the automation service.</li>
    <li>To create and publish pins on Pinterest on your behalf.</li>
    <li>To improve and optimize our App's functionality.</li>
    <li>To communicate with you about service updates and technical issues.</li>
    <li>To ensure security and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> We share your content (images, titles, descriptions, and links) with Pinterest through their official API to create pins on your behalf.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use trusted cloud hosting and infrastructure providers to store and process data in a secure manner.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by applicable law or to protect our legal rights and the rights of our users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is stored using industry-standard security measures. We use
    appropriate technical and organisational safeguards to protect your
    information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
    destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    We store your Pinterest access tokens and related credentials only to the
    extent necessary to provide the automation service. Access tokens are
    stored securely and are used solely to create and manage pins on your
    behalf through the Pinterest API. You can revoke this access at any time
    via your Pinterest account settings or by contacting us, after which the
    tokens will no longer be usable.
  </p>
  <p>
    We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to provide our
    services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
    agreements.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Pinterest API Integration</h2>
  <p>Our App uses the Pinterest API v5 to create pins on your behalf. By using our App, you grant us permission to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your Pinterest boards and pin information as permitted by you.</li>
    <li>Create new pins with the content (images, titles, descriptions, and links) you provide.</li>
    <li>Read your board data as needed to facilitate pin creation and automation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can revoke this access at any time through your Pinterest account
    settings. Once access is revoked, our App will no longer be able to create
    new pins or access your Pinterest data.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal data, subject to applicable law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your personal data, subject to legal and contractual limitations.</li>
    <li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> Withdraw consent for data processing at any time, where processing is based on consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Request your data in a commonly used, machine-readable format, where technically feasible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    Our App may use cookies or similar technologies to maintain your session
    and improve user experience. You can control cookie settings through your
    browser preferences. Disabling cookies may affect some features of the
    App.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our App is not intended for users under the age of 18. We do not knowingly
    collect personal information from children. If you believe we have
    collected information from a child, please contact us so that we can take
    appropriate steps to delete such information.
  </p>

  <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>

    Although the App is operated from Bangalore, India, some data may be
    stored or processed on servers located outside India, including within the
    European Union. Where such transfers occur, we implement appropriate
    safeguards to protect your data in accordance with applicable laws.
